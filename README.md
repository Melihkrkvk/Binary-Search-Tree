# Binary Search Tree

[7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] Write the Binary-Search-Tree stages of the sequence.

### Our root number 7
* Left side of 7
  * We chose 5 because it is less then 7
  * Since 1 is less than 5, we write it to the left
  * Since the number 3 is less than 5, we wrote it to the left of 5
  * Since the number 6 is more than 5, we wrote it to the right of 5
  * Since the number 0 is less then 6, we wrote it to the left of 6
  * Since the number 4 is more than 0, we wrote to the right side of 0
  * Since the number 2 is less than 4, we wrote to the left side of 4
* Right side of 7
  * We wrote 8 because more than 7
  * Since the number 9 more than 8, we wrote it to the right side of 8
